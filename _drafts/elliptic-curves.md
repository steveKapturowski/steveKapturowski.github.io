title:     Elliptic Curve Cryptography
date:      2015-05-01
summary:   Elliptic curves form the basis of a very powerful form of asymmetric key cryptography and are pervasive in pure mathematics; being the object of intense mathematical study in number theory and algebraic geometry. Here, we'll implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange using elliptic curves, and learn how a poorly designed elliptic curve can be attacked.
