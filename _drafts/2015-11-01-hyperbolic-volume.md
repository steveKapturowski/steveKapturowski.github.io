summary:   ! "Let's get this out of the way: Knot theory is fucking awesome. I was outright stunned in the best of possible ways when I first heard from my professor of Honor's Calcus and Game Theory that such a thing existed and mathematicians actually studied it; and so naturally I had to learn more. In what follows I will try my best to paint in broad strokes what in my opinion is one of the most striking features of knots: that <i>most</i> knots and links living in the 3-sphere have complements that can be given a unique hyperbolic structure independent of the particular embedding of the knot."

Let's get this out of the way: Knot theory is fucking awesome. I was outright stunned in the best of possible ways when I first heard from my professor of Honor's Calcus and Game Theory that such a thing existed and mathematicians actually studied it; and so naturally I had to learn more. In what follows I will try my best to paint in broad strokes what in my opinion is one of the most striking features of knots: that <i>most</i> knots and links living in the 3-sphere have complements that can be given a unique hyperbolic structure independent of the particular embedding of the knot.

To get to my stated goal I have to assume a great deal of mathematical sophistication, but will endeavor to include as many references as possible to elucidate the necessary background and focus on those aspects of the problem for which in my experience it is most difficult to find good explanations. Make sure you know what link diagrams and 3-spheres are before you go any further.

Topologically a 3-sphere is the same as two copies of $$B^3$$ with their boundaries identified. Given any knot in $$S^3$$ you can arrange so that the knot lies in the thickened neighborhood $$S^2 \times I$$ where you glue the two together. Using this arrangement as a starting point we'll build a triangulation of $$S^3 \setminus K$$.



## A Bit of Hyperbolic Geometry


$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$$

$$V = L(\alpha) + L(\beta) + L(\gamma)$$

$$L = - \int_0^x\ln\vert 2\sin(t) \vert dt$$


<i>Definition:</i> a <i>Hyperbolic Structure</i> on a manifold M is an atlas $$\{\phi_i:U \rightarrow H^n \vert U \subset M\}$$ such that the transition maps $$\phi_i \circ phi_j^{-1}$$ are isometries of $$H^n$$
