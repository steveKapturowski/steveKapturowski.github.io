title:     Fun with RNNs and an NES Soundchip
date:      2015-12-01
summary:   RNNs are a popular tool for music generation and any number of machine learning blogs will attest to that fact. But while there have been some impressive results, I've always been left a bit unsatisfied that they typically lack structure and progression beyond maybe a few measures. I attempt to use <i>recursive</i> rather than recurrent neural networks along with constraints on interlayer connections to better incorporate these and other ideas inpired by music theory. And because the standard MIDI piano is boring I'll instead be streaming the compositions to my NES's RP2A03 soundchip for some authentic 8-bit glory.
