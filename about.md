I come from a strange place where [Buffalo buffalo, Buffalo buffalo buffalo, buffalo buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo). I'm a physicist turned software engineer who's passionate about mathematics, physics, and machine learning. I love finding beautiful solutions to challenging problems. 

Currently located in Denver where the microbreweries and mountains are in abundance, but looking to move to the west coast.
