title:     Stellar Collapse, Or How does an event horizon form anyway?
date:      2015-05-01
summary:   Black holes present us with a seeming endless supply of paradoxes and that is certainly at root of why we find them so endlessly fascinating. While some of these are legitimate paradoxes which have yet to be satisfactorily resolved, there are others having perfectly sound explanations and yet seem immune to being widely communicated. Which brings us to the question; <i>how do black holes form in finite time anyway?</i>
