title:     MCMC, Renormalization, and the Ising Model
date:      2015-05-01
summary:   The Ising model is a simplified description of ferromagnetism where spin-up and spin-down states sit on a d-dimensional lattice with an interaction defined between spins on neighboring sites. In one and two dimensions this model is analytically soluble, but because of that it makes a perfect playground to learn about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; a powerful tool with diverse applications in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory.
